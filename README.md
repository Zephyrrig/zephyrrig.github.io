## Websites I Recommend
- [Bing](https://www.bing.com) - I find Bing to be a more usable web browser than google lately, and it has the added bonus of giving you rewards for using it as a search engine, I have gotten free games and controllers for using it.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - Youtube has been one of the most useful websites for learning how to do almost anything, with video tutorials. It's also great for background noise while working on homework with longform content.
